# Frontend Mentor - Profile card component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

### What I learned

If you are also usign hsl color in your projects than this will be helpful.

During this challenge, I learned the new way of defining hsl color with css variables.

To see how I used hsl color in this project, see below:

```css
:root {
	--clr-dark-cyan: 185 75% 39%;
	--clr-dark-blue: 229 23% 23%;
	--clr-grayish-blue: 227 10% 46%;
	--clr-dark-gray: 0 0% 59%;
}

h1 {
	font-size: 18px;
	color: hsl(var(--clr-dark-blue));
}
```
This way you have control over color opacity. You don't have to define 'opacity' property to your background in css. To control the background-color opacity put '/' and opacity value. As you can see below:

```css
h1 {
	font-size: 18px;
	color: hsl(var(--clr-dark-blue) / .5);
}
```
